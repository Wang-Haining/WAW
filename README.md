# WAW
WAW is the acronym for "Words Against Words." 
We aim to make WAW a small yet powerful package help users check some words against the whole bunch of words that fed into WAW.
WAW provides some popular linguistic words list, i.e., function words list, the VOA "special English wordbook," and CET4/6 in the mainland China, etc.
Also, users are supported to upload whichever word list you'd like to check against with.
Thanks.
